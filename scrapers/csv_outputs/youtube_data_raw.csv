I really enjoyed this video and how Mr. Khan shared how he thinks AI could transform the classroom and help students. This is a topic I am interested in, and I am diving deeper into how I can safely incorporate it into my classroom. Most of your videos in your playlist were around the topic of AI, but then you also had videos that did a good job covering other topics such as online safety, cyberbullying, and protecting your privacy. While many of your videos would be too advanced for my elementary students, I think they would be a perfect addition to any middle or high school classroom.

16,YouTube,@JCol-o3n,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJP5GqnTrNo,"AI can be helpful in education. It shouldn‚Äôt be used to make everyone think alike or create narrow and limited paths to truth. We have never gotten all of our water from the same place. In essence AI gives us all the same water troff, around the world. This could be hazardous if it limits the direction of physics or mathematics. If it creates broad and tighter models, yes even unintentionally perhaps. It could be making very basic decisions for everyone that they will no longer get to decide. We don‚Äôt want youths to be filled like vessels by AI, we want them to think the small things out as they grow. This is normal so they know how they got there. It needs to be done individually on an individual road in order to protect the quantum fields of infinity. AI can be a shortcut. Do we want it? Yes, if it helps with math. But we also want children to learn in very unique ways. This process helps students in life. Marita may go home and get a Khan Academy video. Jesi may have his older brother explain it. It‚Äôs good to have infinite sources and to not value one over the other because processes render different answers in life.<br><br>The fact so many will choose a computer as teacher does impact society. It can make instruction more accurate, but it also could mean personal teaching won‚Äôt be preferred or necessary in 20 years. Is that good? Maybe. How much contact do kids and people want. We already spend so much time on phones not communicating with people. That with AI will increase. Do people want to interact with other people as much? These are the decisions that AI makes for society at a base level. The decisions about advancements and the small details, even in degrees, will lead to a different destination. That‚Äôs why thinking about AI impacts are imoortant.<br><br>AI right now is not artificial intelligence. It‚Äôs just computers retrieving information in an ordered way to be more helpful to the user. Computers are learning more and more to speak our language fluently and order the information it keeps in its memory. The tasks it can do well are ones that demand accuracy.<br><br>The ‚ÄúAI revolution‚Äù is not to be compared to the computer revolution. That was much larger. Quantum computers could be the game changer again. So far the hype about Chat GPT is hype. I can tell when it is being used and the quality of written materials have declined. I can tell when I‚Äôm getting a canned response in my email. I ignore the bulk mail. I‚Äôll read the hand written one sent to me. So Id call AI Automatic response based on programmer &amp; info at hand. Is it convenient? Yes. Is it limited and can be wildly inaccurate?

22,YouTube,@WilliamSteMarie-or4sh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJP5GqnTrNo,"This is certainly one of the more positive ways to use AI. I see a lot of potential in having AI use the socratic method rather than spitting out answers. However, I have many concerns: If you can just ask a character its motivations or what something symbolizes, where is the act of interpretation? Also, who is to say there is one correct interpretation or that the AI&#39;s one is accurate? Also, a lot of people talk about lesson planning like it&#39;s a chore and not  an important part of a teacher&#39;s imprint/philosophy. I know that for me, lesson planning is a huge part of my instruction, and it is very closely tied to my teaching philosophy/who I am.  Having AI write with you seems like a decent idea, but it sort of devalues just how important choices are in writing and your voice as a writer. Could you imagine if the greats just tag-teamed their novels with AI? How would their voice be consistent? How much of the plot/creative choices would be influenced by something regurgitating random things? How much do students come to rely on AI for help? Does this make them feel less comfortable asking a teacher for help? What happens when it hallucinates? Will the students believe the teacher over the AI? Eventually, will the teachers even know the AI is hallucinating or will they also become overreliant?",N/A,N/A,N/A,"Video: How AI Could Save (Not Destroy) Education | Sal Khan | TED, Channel: TED"

That is precisely wrong!<br><br>To be educated, the student needs to be able to make her own connections.  She didn&#39;t do this.  If the student read the book, the book says that the green light is at the end of Daisy&#39;s dock across the bay.  The student should be able to make the connection, not be told the connection.

AI now writes reports and essays for an entire generation of students that can no longer can read a book, internalize that knowledge by jotting down notes and then using those notes to create an original thought or thesis, that is to be written in their own words.  By this time-intensive struggle, knowledge becomes understanding within the self, something termed Somatic Knowledge. With ChatGPT, even the act of &quot;cut and paste&quot; statements is removed.  Merely enter a prompt, (I guess this is cut and pasted) and magically a paper for marking is produced.  Many educators I know, now complain this a problem.  Increasingly, knowledge for our students is Exosomatic, in that it is never comprehended, only retrieved.  This is not KNOWING.  In his speech at the Perimeter Institute, polymath Freeman Dyson claimed that in the year 2000 it became cheaper to store information than to understand it.  Thus the general public is made increasingly dumber, which is just how our current political leaders want it. <br>Early on, TED talks used to be good.  No longer.

It may have started as Khan tutoring family members but has grown beyond that. Why was it needed? <br>We can all think back to when at school on the teachers who were good at getting information across - and those who were not. Especially in more complex subjects such as physics or, say, statistics. Why the difference? What if you could recreate the things the good teacher did? <br>Most schools do not teach you how to learn. They are trying to impart info you are expected to remember and, therefore, learn. But not how to learn. Great books like Make it Stick show how most teachers don‚Äôt know or understand how we learn or how information moves from short term memory to long term memory.  When you look at how Khan Academy is structured it does apply most of that thinking. Educational departments are signing up Khan Academy - likely to supplement their programs - but many will actually learn more from Khan Academy than their classroom teacher.<br>We still need a real person to prod us, provoke us, encourage us to learn - so I am not proposing we get rid of teachers but there are many areas we take for granted and have not looked at more deeply. Same for the way doctors diagnose patients. They all do it differently with varying levels of success. When anything is reliant on the variations and vagaries of individuals over a systemic approach, we are going to get dramatic variance in results.",N/A,N/A,N/A,"Video: How AI Could Save (Not Destroy) Education | Sal Khan | TED, Channel: TED"
